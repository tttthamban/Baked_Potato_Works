    <h3 class="scthead">Savings Accounts</h3>
    <p>
    You can make deposits and withdrawals, but usually can't write checks. They usually pay an interest rate that's higher than a checking account, but lower than a money market account or CD. Some savings accounts have a passbook, in which transactions are logged in a small booklet that you keep, while others have a monthly or quarterly statement detailing the transactions. Some savings accounts charge a fee if your balance falls below a specified minimum.

    <h3 class="scthead">Basic Checking Accounts</h3>
    <p>
    Sometimes also called "no frills" accounts, these offer a limited set of services at a low cost. You'll be able to perform basic functions, such as check writing, but they lack some of the bells and whistles of more comprehensive accounts. They usually do not pay interest, and they may restrict or impose additional fees for excessive activity, such as writing more than a certain number of checks per month.

    <h3 class="scthead">Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs)</h3>
    <p>
    These accounts invest your balance in short-term debt such as commercial paper, Treasury Bills, or CDs. The rates they offer tend to be slightly higher than those on interest-bearing checking accounts, but they usually require a higher minimum balance to start earning interest. These accounts provide only limited check writing privileges (three transfers by check, and six total transfers, per month), and often impose a service fee if your balance falls below a certain level.
